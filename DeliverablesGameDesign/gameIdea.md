# Game Idea - Tower defense

## The concept
We will create a single player tower defense with the theme of a bank robbery. You need to protect your money from different types of robbers. The player has different weapons at his disposal to eliminate the enemy and he will have to establish the best strategy to protect the bank's money and get the best score.

## How the game is played
The game takes place in a simple stage where the player can see his banque with an amount of money that represents his life in the game, a portal where each wave of enemies come from and the tower the player can use to defend his bank.
When the party starts, a first enemy's wave appears and follows a path to the bank to steal the money. The player can place his tower at a precise point to try to eliminate the enemy.
- The party is won when all of the waves are eliminated
- The party is over when all the money is stolen

### Ennemies
In order to be more challenging we decided to implement 5 class of enemies:
| Types   	| Characteristics 	|
|---------	|-----------------	|
| Warrior 	|                 	|
| Thief   	|                 	|
| Tank    	|                 	|
| Boss    	|                 	|
| Special 	|                 	|

### Weapons/Powers
To defend his bank the player have the choice between 5 class of weapons or powers:
| Types                	| Characteristics 	|
|----------------------	|-----------------	|
| Gunner               	|                 	|
| Area of Effect (AOE) 	|                 	|
| Slow                 	|                 	|
