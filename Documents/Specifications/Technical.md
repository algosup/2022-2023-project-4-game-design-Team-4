## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose of the document

This document is a technical specification of the game we are going to create. It is a document that will be used by the team to guide the development of the game. It will be used to define the game's universe, the game's mechanics and the game's assets.

### 1.2. Purpose of the project

The purpose of this project is to create a fully working game using Unreal Engine 4. We are completely free to choose the theme of the game, the game mechanics and the game's universe.

Our group has chosen to create a Tower Defense game based on a bank universe
