# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. Purpose of the document

This document is the functional specification of the game. It describes the game's features and the rules that govern them. It is intended for the development team, the testers and the players.

## 1.2. Purpose of the project 

The purpose of this project is to create a fully working game using Unreal Engine 4. We are completely free to choose the theme of the game, the game mechanics and the game's universe.

Our group has chosen to create a Tower Defense game based on a bank universe


# 2. Goal of the project

The goal of the project is to design, code, and produce a full game using Unreal Engine 4. It will, of course, be a small but polished game. Design, UI/UX, and testing are crucial. 

The final game will have to feature some sort of gameplay innovation, and be as bug-free as possible, as well as a polished, fun, thoroughly tested and iterated upon project. 

## 2.1. In scope

// TODO

## 2.2. Out of scope

A mobile version of the game is not planned for the moment. The game will be available on PC only.

Also, the game will be exclusively in English for the moment, a French translation will be added later.
