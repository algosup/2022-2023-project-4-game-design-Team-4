	<strong>Welcome to Vault Vanguard, a video game developed during a school project for <a href="https://algosup.com/">ALGOSUP</a>!</strong>
</p>

## About the Project

This project was made by a team of 5 students during a school project. The objective was to create a video game with Unreal Engine 4.27 during the period from February 27 to April 7.

## About the Game

Vault Vanguard is a tower defense game where you have to protect a bank from the evil Giovanni Machiavelli and his minions. To do so, you have to build turrets and improve them to stop the enemies from reaching the vault.

### Synopsis

**``Vaultburg, 2048``**

```Following the financial shock of 2047, many people have started attacking banks in order to steal the few resources still stored to survive. However, the banks don't take this lying down and decide to arm themselves. They also call on you, a ship owner, to improve their defense. Use your knowledge to transform a bank into a fortress designed to withstand all external assaults!```
